# MLFlow practice

This is a project to help me(mR. T) get familiar with MLFlow. Previously I used the experiment tracking in Azure ML studio but the commands are specific to that platform. At work I don't have an Azure account and the organization seems sticky with security so this should be kept separate from my work ML toolkit. 

I'm going to be using the Kaggle time series forcasting data found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting
